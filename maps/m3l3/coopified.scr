//chrissstrahl - this file contains functions to optimize m3l3 script
//m3l3 is especially Ã¼berfucktardish reduandant, what ever drove the developers
//to be crazy to that point I can't imagine, I estimate that the script file
//currently over 7000 lines could be reduced to under 2000 if it where
//properly done.
//
//The reason why this is so upsetting is it costs lots of time and increeses
//the likley hood of errors when converting to a coop mod compatible state

//deal with accuracy
